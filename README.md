### How to play

- To move our character you should use the left and arrow keys on your keyboard.
- You can jump with the up arrow key, you can do one extra jump while on air performing a 'double jump'.
- To shoot an 'ink bullet' you should press the space key on your keyboard.

#### Bob the hero

- This is our hero, he dies if hit by any enemy.

#### Enemies

![dolphin](./readmeImg/dolphinReadme.png)

- The Dolphin is our basic enemy. Moves left/right and dies after being hit once by our shoot.

![jelly](./readmeImg/jellyReadme.png)

- The Jelly is a simple enemy that moves up/down and dies on 1 hit.

![whale](./readmeImg/whaleReadme.png)

- The Whale moves left/right. To kill the whale you need to hit 3 times.

![seahorse](./readmeImg/seahorseReadme.png)

- The Sea Horse is an aggressive enemy. Moves left/right and shoot a bubble that can kill our hero, be careful! Dies after being hit once

![agrofish](./readmeImg/agroReadme.png)

- This fish is also an aggressive enemy. Moves left/right and shoot a bold that can kill our hero. To kill it you need to hit twice.


#### Interactive Scenario

![chest](./readmeImg/chestReadme.png)

- Our goal is to reach the chest, as soon as we got it we finish our quest. The seconds you had left on the clock are then converted into points (Each second worth 5 points at the end).

![lever](./readmeImg/leverReadme.png)

- At some points, you will face a wall of seaweed. In order to open that wall, you need to activate the lever. You can do it by touching or shooting it.

## Templates

- To create the game I used 2 different templates that helped improve the project. They are the basic template for Phaser 3 [you can find here](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser3-project-template) created by Richard Davey. Another template I used that implemented some help functionalities to render and align my characters from [William Clarkson](https://williamclarkson.net).

## Design Credits

- The background used is from free assets on [itch io](https://ansimuz.itch.io/underwater-fantasy-pixel-art-environment)
- Most sea creatures are also from free assets you can find it [here](https://rapidpunches.itch.io/)
- The main character octopus is a twitch mascot from [hicelina](https://www.twitch.tv/hicelina) the original art creator is [Michael Perez](https://pixelfly.artstation.com/).
